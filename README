This project provides a function which takes a simple features (sf) object (e.g. imported shapefile) covering part of a U.S. state and returns that object with Census demographic data added to each polygon.

This project was started as a collaboration by Sarah Hugenberger, Adrianna Maberry, Scott Macdonell, and Maia Woluchem at the Austin MGGG hackathon.

Initially, there were two parts, a Shiny app and the R function AddCensusDemographics.R. This project seperates out the R script to make it easily installable (i.e. devtools::install_github("stmacdonell/AddCensus"))

The function is in R/AddCensusDemographics.R. Some necessary data is in data/. Refcode/ contains code used to test if the code is working. At the moment refcode/TestCode.R will not run locally as it refers to files not included in this repo to keep the size of the repo small. However, it provides a basic example of how to use the function AddCensusDemographics. (You may want to find some of your own shapefiles to test with before contributing.)

+**Purpose**
Enable a user to take their own shapefile and retrieve the same shapefile with U.S. Census data added. The script AddCensusDemographics.R provides a function which should allow users to access this functionality within their own R scripts.

**How**
This project provides a function which takes a simple features (sf) object (polygon shapefile in R) covering part of a U.S. state and returns that object with Census demographic data added to each polygon. The function uses the Census API to download Census demographics at the block level and then determines which blocks are in which polygon from the user's sf object. The function calculates the portion of the area of each block within each of the polygons from the user's sf object. The value of a demographic within a user's polygon is then the sum of that demographic in each block times the portion of that block within the polygon.
